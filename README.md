# QLD_Cyclone_Prediction
As part of a MSc program, there is a research component. I have chosen to research the effect of Deep Learning techniques such as a WGAN model on Cyclone/extreme weather prediction in the northern QLD area.

## Project Overview
This research explores the application of Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN) and hybrid deep learning approaches to improve tropical cyclone prediction accuracy in Northern Queensland. The project combines meteorological data analysis with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to develop more reliable forecasting models for extreme weather events.

## Seeking to improve Already in Use WGAN:
- Integration of multiple meteorological variables at high temporal resolution (3-hourly and 30-minute intervals)
- Implementation of a novel hybrid TrajGRU-CNN architecture with WGAN, trained on data collected from the Burea Of Meteorology.
